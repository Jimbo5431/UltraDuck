For android install, [see this link](https://github.com/Jimbo5431/UltraDuck/blob/main/android.md)<br />

The page title will now change to "üí®ü¶Ü (RFY/AFA/AI)" when the page refresher is running.<br />
If it shows the original "Amazon vine" or "‚è∏ü¶Ü" title, the refresher is not running.

Refreshes the vine page every 3 to 10 seconds as long as the tab is not focused and there are no items showing.<br />
If an item is found, or a CAPTCHA occurs, the script will stop running on all tabs that it's open on. Refresh each tab after completing CAPTCHA.<br />
Quacks when item found. Pages that it runs on, and notifications can be customised easily.<br />

### How to install
- You will need a userscript addon for your browser. I use Violentmonkey. There are others available. Install one.
- Use [this link](https://github.com/Jimbo5431/UltraDuck/raw/main/UltraDuck.user.js) to install the script.
- In site settings in chrome (see below), or permissions > autoplay in firefox, make sure to allow amazon.co.uk for sound.
- Open the required page, and hide all items.
- Refresh page.
- Click somewhere in the page to enable sound to work.
- Go use a different tab or app.

After an item has been found, the script will be stopped until you refresh the page manually.
Just hide any items you don't want, hit F5, and click somewhere in the page again before focusing on a different window.

**${\textsf{\color{red}Important: Page refresh only works when the tab/window is not currently active.}}$** <br />
**${\textsf{\color{red}Simply pull up another window in front, such as file explorer or another browser window.}}$**
